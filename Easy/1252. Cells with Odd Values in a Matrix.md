### Q :
> Given n and m which are the dimensions of a matrix initialized by zeros and given an array indices where indices[i] = [ri, ci]. For each pair of [ri, ci] you have to increment all cells in row ri and column ci by 1.
>
> Return the number of cells with odd values in the matrix after applying the increment to all indices.

> Input: n = 2, m = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
> Output: 6

### A:


```python
class Solution:
    def oddCells(self, n: int, m: int, indices: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        row , col = [0] * n , [0] * m
        
        for i in indices:
            row[i[0]] ^= 1
            col[i[1]] ^= 1
        
        return sum([x ^ y for x in row for y in col])
```
