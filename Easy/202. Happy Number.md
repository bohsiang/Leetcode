### Q :
> Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
>
> A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

### A:



```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        d = set()
        while n not in d:
            d.add(n)
            n = sum([int(i)**2 for i in str(n)])
        return n == 1
```
