### Q :
> Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.
>
> You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).
>
> A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

> Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

### A:

這題要確認此字串有沒有在另一個字串出現並且順序是相同的

以上面的例子s = abc要去判斷有沒有在另一個t字串出現相同順序

t = **a** ~h~ **b** ~gd~ **c**　所以回true

我的方法是當遇到相同字的時候就把最前面的字pop掉

接著最後比對字串是否為空值

若是空值代表所有字順序與另一個字串一樣就為我們的答案了

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        for i in t:
            if s == "":
                return True
            if i == s[0]:
                s = s[1:]            
        return s == ""
```
