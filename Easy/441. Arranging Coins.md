### Q :
> You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
>
> Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
>
> n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

> ```
> Input: n = 5
> Output: 2
> The coins can form the following rows:
> ¤
> ¤ ¤
> ¤ ¤
> ```

### A:




```python
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        # My Method
        i = 1
        while n > 0:
            n = n - i
            if n < 0:
                break
            i += 1
        return i - 1
        
        # The math Method
        return int((math.sqrt(8 * n + 1)-1)/2)```
