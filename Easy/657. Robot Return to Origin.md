這題的概念是假設一開始站在原點

經過輸入的字串進行移動，最後是否會回到原點

利用上面的例子

是先往上走("U")接著往下走("D")，所以會回到原點

這題的概念就是計算出上與下、左與右的個數是否一樣

若是一樣的話代表會走回原點反之則不會

```python 
class Solution:
    def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:
        if (moves.count("R") == moves.count("L") and moves.count("U") == moves.count("D")):
            return True
        else:
            return False


```
