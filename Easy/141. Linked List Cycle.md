### Q :
> Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
>
> To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.


> ```
> Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
> Output: true

### A:





```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        d = {}
        while head:
            if head in d.keys():
                return True
            d[head] = 0
            head = head.next
        return False    
            
```
