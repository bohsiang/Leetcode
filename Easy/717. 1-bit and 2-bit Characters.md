### Q :
> We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
>
> Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

> Input: bits = [1, 0, 0]

### A:


```python
class Solution:class Solution:
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits: List[int]) -> bool:
        i = 0
        while i < len(bits)-1:
            if bits[i] == 1:
                i += 2
            else:
                i += 1
        return i == len(bits)-1
```
