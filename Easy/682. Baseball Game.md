> 3. "D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
> 4. "C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.

### A:

這題主要是處理陣列數值的問題

有三個字元要做處理分別為"+"、"C"、"D"

"C"為移除當前陣列的最後一個值

"D"為將當前陣列的最後一個值加倍

"+"為將當前陣列的最後一個值與倒數第二個值相加

所以這程式非常的直觀遇到"C"時`pop()`最後一個值

遇到"D"時找到最後一個值乘上兩倍

遇到"+"時最後一個值+倒數第二個值

其餘的就填入陣列最後將陣列內所有的值相加輸出答案就好了


```python
class Solution:
    def calPoints(self, ops: List[str]) -> int:
        ans = []
        for i in ops:
            if i == "C":
                ans.pop()
            elif i =="D":
                ans.append(2 * ans[-1])
            elif i == "+":
                ans.append(ans[-1] + ans[-2])
            else:
                ans.append(int(i))
                
        return sum(ans)
 ```
