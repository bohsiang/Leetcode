### A:


```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        hash_table = {}
        
        for i in nums:
            if i in hash_table:
                hash_table[i] += 1
            else:
                hash_table[i] = 1
        for i,j in hash_table.items():
            if j == 1:
                return i
```
