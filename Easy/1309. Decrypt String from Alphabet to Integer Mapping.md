### Q :
> Given a string s formed by digits ('0' - '9') and '#' . We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:
>
> - Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
> - Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively. 
> Return the string formed after mapping.
>
> It's guaranteed that a unique mapping will always exist.

> ```
> Input: s = "10#11#12"
> Output: "jkab"

### A:


```python
class Solution:
    def freqAlphabets(self, s: str) -> str:
        return "".join(chr(int(i[:2]) + 96) for i in re.findall('\d\d#|\d',s))
```
