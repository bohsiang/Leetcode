### Q :
> On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.
>
> You can move according to the next rules:
>
> In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).
> You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.

> ```
> points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
> Output: 7
> ```

### A:

這題是要依照座標計算出經過所有點走的最短時間

所以依照上面的例子[1,1]➔[3,4]最少要走3步▶[1,1] **->** [2,2] **->** [3,3] **->** [3,4]

[3,4]➔[-1,0]最少要走4步▶ [3,4] **->**  [2,3] **->**  [1,2] **->**  [0,1] **->**  [-1,0]   

所以花費最少時間就是7sec

依上面的規則可以發現 x and y 與前一組x and y相減的最大值會是最少要走的步數

將其進行加總就會是最後的結果了


```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        return sum(max(abs(c[0] - p[0]),abs(c[1] - p[1])) for c,p in zip(points,points[1:]))
```
