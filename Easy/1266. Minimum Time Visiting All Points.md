### Q :
> On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.
>
> You can move according to the next rules:
>
> In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).
> You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.

> ```
> points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
> Output: 7
> ```

***

### A:


```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        return sum(max(abs(c[0] - p[0]),abs(c[1] - p[1])) for c,p in zip(points,points[1:]))
```
