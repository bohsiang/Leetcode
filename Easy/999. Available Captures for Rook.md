### Q :
> On an 8 x 8 chessboard, there is one white rook.  There also may be empty squares, white bishops, and black pawns.  These are given as characters 'R', '.', 'B', and 'p' respectively. Uppercase characters represent white pieces, and lowercase characters represent black pieces.
>
> The rook moves as in the rules of Chess: it chooses one of four cardinal directions (north, east, west, and south), then moves in that direction until it chooses to stop, reaches the edge of the board, or captures an opposite colored pawn by moving to the same square it occupies.  Also, rooks cannot move into the same square as other friendly bishops.
> 
> Return the number of pawns the rook can capture in one move.

### A:

這題的概念就是要計算白色城堡(R)能夠吃到多少小兵(p)

如果其中有自己人(B)的話則不能直接吃到

所以必須找出能夠吃到最多小兵的結果

其實最好的狀況就是四個角落都有黑色的小兵最大值是4

除非他們之間有自己人(B)影響路徑

我的做法是先找出白色城堡(R)的位置接著將Col、Row做儲存

然後將`.`替換成`空格`最後計算`Rp`的個數

因為沒有自己人的狀況下順向跟反向都只會有一組解

有自己人的情況下`Rp`就不成立


```python
class Solution:
    def numRookCaptures(self, A: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        
        col = [i for i in zip(*A) if "R" in i]
        row = [i for i in A if "R" in i]
        col = "".join(col[0]).replace(".","")
        row = "".join(row[0]).replace(".","")
    
        return sum(i.count("Rp") for i in [col,col[::-1],row,row[::-1]])```
