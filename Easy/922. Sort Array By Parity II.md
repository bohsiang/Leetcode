### Q :
> Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.

> Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.
>
> You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

### A:



```python
class Solution:
    def sortArrayByParityII(self, A: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = [0]*len(A)
        even , odd = 0 , 1
        for i in range(len(A)):
            if A[i] % 2 == 0:
                ans[even] = A[i]                
                even += 2
            else:
                ans[odd] = A[i]
                odd += 2
        return ans
```
